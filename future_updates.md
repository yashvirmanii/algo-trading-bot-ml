Phase 5: Infrastructure & Deployment
Task 12: Model Serving Pipeline
Build a ModelServingPipeline that:
- Serves multiple ML models simultaneously with load balancing
- Implements A/B testing for model deployment
- Handles model versioning and rollback capabilities
- Provides real-time inference with <10ms latency
- Includes model performance monitoring and alerting

Technical requirements:
- Use FastAPI for serving endpoints
- Implement model caching and batch inference
- Add request/response logging
- Include health checks and model status monitoring
- Implement graceful model updates without downtime
- Add inference result validation and sanity checks

Point 6: Dynamic Trailing Stop-Loss & Profit Target System
Your Example Breakdown:
Initial: Price=₹10, Target=₹12 (+20%), SL=₹9 (-10%)
After move: Price=₹11, Target=₹13 (+18%), SL=₹10 (-9%)
Logic: Both SL and target "trail" the price movement
Technical Feasibility:
✅ Live Data Access:
Zerodha Kite Connect: Provides real-time tick data
WebSocket feeds: Live price updates every few seconds
Accuracy: Very accurate for NSE/BSE stocks during market hours
Latency: Usually 1-3 seconds delay (acceptable for this strategy)
✅ Implementation Approach:
Method 1: Continuous Monitoring

Background process: Continuously monitor open positions
Price tracking: Track current price vs entry price
Dynamic updates: Adjust SL/Target as price moves favorably
Broker updates: Send modified orders to broker
Method 2: Bracket Orders (if supported)

Zerodha feature: Some brokers support trailing stop-loss orders
Automatic: Broker handles the trailing logic
Less control: Limited customization options
Implementation Details:
Trailing Logic Options:
Fixed Amount: SL trails by fixed ₹1 for every ₹1 profit
Percentage-based: SL trails by 50% of the favorable move
ATR-based: Trail based on Average True Range (volatility-adjusted)
Hybrid: Combination of percentage + minimum distance
Risk Management:
Minimum profit lock: Don't trail until minimum profit achieved
Maximum trail distance: Prevent SL from getting too far
Volatility adjustment: Wider trails for volatile stocks
Current System Integration:
File: core/risk_reward.py (needs enhancement)
Live monitoring: New background process needed
Order management: Integration with core/order_executor.py
Challenges & Solutions:
⚠️ Potential Issues:
Over-trading: Too frequent SL adjustments
Whipsaws: Price moves up/down rapidly
API limits: Too many order modification requests



while trading i need the sl and profit target to be dynamic so for example if curretn price is 10 then profit target is 12 and sl is 9 and as soon as the current price moves to 11 the profit target moves up to become 13 and the stop lose also gets up and become 10 is that achievable ? do we have acces to live data that accurately ?

Yes, this is absolutely achievable! What you're describing is called a "Trailing Stop-Loss" system.


Point 4: Bidirectional Trading Architecture
Two Trading Types Required:
Type 1: Long Trades (Buy First, Sell Later)
Traditional approach: Buy stock → Hold → Sell at higher price
Profit mechanism: Price appreciation (buy low, sell high)
Risk: Stock price goes down
Use case: Positive sentiment + bullish technical signals
Type 2: Short Trades (Sell First, Buy Later)
Short selling: Sell borrowed stock → Wait → Buy back at lower price
Profit mechanism: Price depreciation (sell high, buy low)
Risk: Stock price goes up
Use case: Negative sentiment + bearish technical signals
System-Wide Implementation Requirements:
All Components Must Support Both:
Specialized Agents: Each agent can generate both BUY and SELL signals
Multi-Agent Coordinator: Handle both long and short position allocation
Risk Management: Calculate stop-losses for both directions
Position Sizing: Adjust quantities for both trade types
Portfolio Tracking: Monitor both long and short positions
P&L Calculation: Handle profit/loss for both directions
Notifications: Report both types of trades clearly
Broker Integration:
Margin requirements: Short selling needs margin account
Borrowing mechanism: Access to stock lending for short positions
Settlement handling: Different settlement for short vs long trades
Risk Management Adaptations:
Long trades: Stop-loss below entry, take-profit above
Short trades: Stop-loss above entry, take-profit below
Position limits: Separate limits for long and short exposure
Margin monitoring: Track margin utilization for short positions
This makes the entire system truly bidirectional - capable of profiting in both rising AND falling markets!

Do you want the system to maintain separate capital allocations for long vs short trades, or use the same pool dynamically
